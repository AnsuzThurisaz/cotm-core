# Fondue 6
*A tasty mixture of gooey melted mods for 1.11.2*

Fondue is (or at least, will be) a modpack founded on the following three 
rules:

1. No teleportation. Period. Including items, players, energy, etc.
2. No passive power generation. This includes solar, wind, water, etc.
3. All builds must be at least a little decorative.

These rules are generally enforced via honor system, owing to the modpack's 
origins as a private server pack, but config changes will be made when possible.

To help with the third rule, decorative blocks should be very cheap, sometimes 
going as far as to offer infinite free decor blocks at spawn.

Of course, the modpack also has all the usual "well-designed" modpack things:
no duplicate ores, ore dictionary unification, and thought-out config changes. 
Things won't be changed on a whim, and world compatibility will be maintained 
between minor versions. (i.e: if world compat breaks, that'll be Fondue 7.)

## Mods
The following mods compose the core experience of Fondue 6, and as such, mods 
duplicating their functionality will *not* be added:

* [BuildCraft](https://mod-buildcraft.com)
* [Correlated](https://github.com/elytra/Correlated)
* [RailCraft](http://railcraft.info)

Suggestions to add mods that clash with these three core mods will be 
immediately rejected. As such, do not suggest to add Refined Storage, Thermal 
Dynamics, Ender IO, Applied Energistics, etc etc. Especially do not suggest
these core mods be removed.

Fondue will be distributed on the SurgePlay launcher when it is ready.
