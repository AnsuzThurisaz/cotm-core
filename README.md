# Fondue 6
*A tasty mixture of gooey melted mods for 1.11.2*

**Not yet ready for use.**

Fondue is a modpack founded on the following three rules:

1. No teleportation. Period. Including items, players, energy, etc.
2. No passive power generation. This includes solar, wind, water, etc.
3. All builds must be at least a little decorative.

The modpack has all the usual "thought-out" modpack things: no duplicate ores,
ore dictionary unification, no recipe conflicts, carefully considered config
changes. World compatibility will be maintained between minor versions; if it
is broken, then the pack will become Fondue 7.

## Goals

* Work well on a server with a small-to-medium population. (about 5-24 players)
* Work well in singleplayer.
* Encourage maps lasting a month, preferably much more.
* Be fairly unique, we don't need yet another generic kitchen sink pack.
* But at the same time, include enough mods to give everyone something to do.
* Modify vanilla mechanics where it improves gameplay or balance.
* Encourage exploration.
* Encourage socialization.
* Work at least passably on lesser hardware (<=2GiB of RAM, integrated graphics)

## Non-Goals

* Work well on a server with a large population. (100+ players)
* Allow reverting 3-founding-rule balance changes.
* Require using every mod in the pack through contrived recipes.
* Gating "overpowered" mods, or really any form of gating at all.
* Include every mod possible.
